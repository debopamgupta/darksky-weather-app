#### NOTE:- DARK SKY API WILL BE GOING AWAY SOON / HAS GONE AWAY. IF YOU WANT TO STILL USE THIS AS A TEMPLATE FOR GETTING DATA FROM AN API AND SHOW THAT ON THE PAGE FOR SOME BASIC DOM STUFF, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FREE TO DO SO. :+1:  

DarkSky API helps to gather the weather of a valid location by its coordinates.
IPAPI helps to gather location coordinates with their IP
